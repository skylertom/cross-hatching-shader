# Cross Hatching Shader in WebGL
Implemented based on ["Real-Time Hatching"](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=383328) by Emil et al

Current Status:
* has lab 9 code working so you can implement shading by triangle
* click to add more strokes (just to show you how it uses it), disable later (although we could have something where the user can click on the bunny to make it darker)
* yellow bunny is where the light is coming from
* we should find a cylinder ply file
* I don't have ideas yet on how to make sure the lines will align
    * we might just have to try it to figure it out
